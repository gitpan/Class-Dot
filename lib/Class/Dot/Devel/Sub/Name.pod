Class::Dot::Devel::Sub::Name - Support better debugging output.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes MyClass version 2.0.0_15

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use Class::Dot::Devel::Sub::Name qw(subname);
 
     my $this_pkg = __PACKAGE__;
     my $coderef = subname "$this_pkg\::name_of_this_sub" => sub {
         return 42;
     }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exports C<<< Sub::Name >>>'s C<<< subname >>> function if C<<< Sub::Name >>> is
installed. If it's not installed, C<<< subname >>> is a function that does nothing
except return it's arguments.

Instead of the regular C<<< __ANON__ >>> name of perl subroutine references, which is not
very useful in debugging and diagnostic output, C<<< Sub::Name >>> gives subroutine
references a real name. This is very useful for tasks like profiling and the
like, but is not mission critical if it's not available.

See L<Sub::Name> for more information.
