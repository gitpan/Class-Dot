=head1 NAME

Class::Dot::Meta::Accessor::Overrideable - The default accessor type

=head1 VERSION

This document describes C<<< Class::Dot >>> version 2.0.0_10

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Class::Dot::Meta::Accessor> for usage information.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the default accessors when no C<<< -accessor_type >>> option is set. They
are called C<<< Overrideable >>> because they are easily overrided when the
C<<< -override >>> option is set.

To override a semi-affordance attribute just do this:

     use Class::Dot2 qw(-override);
 
     property name => (isa => 'Str', default => 'George Louis Constanza');
 
     sub name {
         my ($self) = @_;
 
         my $name   = $self->__getattr__('name');
         carp "Someone requested the name of: $name ($self)";
 
         return $name;
     }
 
     sub set_name {
         my ($self, $new_name) = @_;
 
         my $name = $self->__getattr__('name');
         carp "Someone changed $name's name to $new_name ($self)";
         $self->__setattr__('name', $new_name);
 
         return;
     }

If you define your property in a C<<< BEGIN >>>, C<<< INIT >>> or C<<< CHECK >>> block, however,
you have to do it a bit differently:

     BEGIN {
         use Class::Dot2 qw(-override);
         property name => (isa => 'Str', default => 'George Louis Constanza');
 
         after_property_get name => sub {
             my ($self) = @_;
 
             my $name   = $self->__getattr__('name');
             carp "Someone requested the name of: $name ($self)";
 
             return $name;
         }; # << NOTE: the semicolon is required
 
         after_property_set set_name => {
             my ($self, $new_name) = @_;
 
             my $name = $self->__getattr__('name');
             carp "Someone changed $name's name to $new_name ($self)";
             $self->__setattr__('name', $new_name);
 
             return;
         }; # << NOTE: the semicolon is required

=head1 SUBROUTINESE<sol>METHODS

=head2 INSTANCE METHODS

=head3 C<<< create_get_accessor($caller_class, $attribute_name, $attribute_type, $options, $privacy_settings) >>>

The prototype for this function is defined in L<Class::Dot::Meta::Accessor::Base>
and this overridden method behaves accordingly.

=head3 C<<< create_set_accessor($caller_class, $attribute_name, $attribute_type, $options, $privacy_settings) >>>

The prototype for this function is defined in L<Class::Dot::Meta::Accessor::Base>
and this overridden method behaves accordingly.

=head3 C<<< create_mutator($caller_class, $attribute_name, $attribute_type, $options, $privacy_settings) >>>

The prototype for this function is defined in L<Class::Dot::Meta::Accessor::Base>
and this overridden method behaves accordingly.

=head2 PRIVATE CLASS METHODS

=head3 C<<< register_plugin() >>>

Private metadata for L<Class::Plugin::Util>.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 C<<< You tried to set a value with %s(). Did you mean %s() ? >>>

You tried to set a value via an accessor that is a get accessor, not a
mutator. You should probably follow the error message advice.

=head2 C<<< Can't set value with %s(). It's private! >>>

The attribute you tried to set is C<<< private >>> and can't be set like this,
if you feel otherwise, declare it as C<<< public >>>, or set the value via
C<<< $self->__setattr__($attribute_name, $value) >>>.

=head2 C<<< Can only set value with %s(), it's write only! >>>

You tried to get the value from a C<<< writeonly >>> attribute. If you feel the
attribute shouldn't be C<<< writeonly >>> you should declare it as public, or you can
get the value via C<<< $self->__getattr__($attribute_name) >>>.
