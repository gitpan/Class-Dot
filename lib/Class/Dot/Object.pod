=head1 NAME

Class::Dot::Object - The default base object for Class::Dot classes.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes C<<< Class::Dot >>> version 2.0.0_15

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the default base class for L<Class::Dot> classes. You don't have to
inherit from this class manually, it is done automaticly when you import
C<<< Class::Dot >>> in your class.

Actually it is a bit more complex than that, it is the base class for
C<<< Class::Dot >>>'s default metaclass, L<Class::Dot::Meta::Class>.
You can extend it's functionality by subclassing C<<< Class::Dot::Meta::Class >>>
and then set that subclass as the metaclass with the C<<< -metaclass >>> option,
via there you can decide which base class you want.

This class contain useful methods for introspection on your class's
attributes, metaclass and so on.

Notice how this base class has no constructor or destructor, these are built
dynamicly by the metaclass.

=head1 SUBROUTINESE<sol>METHODS

=head2 INSTANCE METHODS

=head3 C<<< __hasattr__($attribute_name) >>>

Returns true if the class has the attribute C<<< $attribute_name >>>.

=head3 C<<< __getattr__($attribute_name) >>>

Get the value of an attribute.

=head3 C<<< __setattr__($attribute_name, $value) >>>

Set the value of an attribute.

B<NOTE> This will not check if the value conforms to the type constraint
even if the C<<< -constrained >>> option is set. To do this dynamically you have to
do it like this:

     my $set_attr = $self->__meta__($attribute)->setter_name();
     $self->$set_attr($value);

=head3 C<<< __meta__($attribute_name >>>)

Return attribute metadata for an attribute by it's name.
This will return the attribute's type instance. See L<Class::Dot::Type>
for the methods available.

=head3 C<<< __metaclass__() >>>

Return the instance of the metaclass for this class.

=head3 C<<< __is_finalized__() >>>

Returns true if this class is finalized.

=head3 C<<< __finalize__() >>>

Finalize the class.
