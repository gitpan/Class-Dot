=head1 NAME

Class::Dot::Registry - Class registry.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Class::Dot version 2.0.0_10

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use Class::Dot::Registry;
 
     my $REGISTRY = Class::Dot::Registry->new();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<WARNING>:
This is a module used internally by L<Class::Dot>. If you are not hacking on
any internals you are most likely better off using the interfaces that uses
this module than using it directly.

Please see L<Class::Dot> and L<Class::Dot::Manual>.

Ok. Now that we got that out of the way; If you are still here you probably
wonder what this module do? This module keeps track of metadata for the
classes that is under L<Class::Dot>'s control. Metadata include things like
class options, attribute settings, class finalization status, ISA caches and
so on. L<Class::Dot> uses this module to store and manipulate this information

=head1 SUBROUTINESE<sol>METHODS

=head2 CLASS CONSTRUCTOR

=head3 C<<< new() >>>

This will return the global class registry as the registry is a singleton

Example:

     my $REGISTRY = Class::Dot::Registry->new();

=head2 INSTANCE METHODS

=head3 C<<< is_class_registered($class >>>)

Returns true if the class is a L<Class::Dot> class.

=head3 C<<< register_class($class) >>>

Register the class as a L<Class::Dot> class.

=head3 C<<< get_metaclass_for($class) >>>

Returns the metaclass instance for C<<< $class >>>.

This is a instance of the class that was set with the
C<<< -metaclass >>> class option.

If the class is not a C<<< Class::Dot >>> class it will still return
an instance of the default metaclass, this is for interoperability with
other object systems (or no object system at all).

If you want to see if a class is a C<<< Class::Dot >>> class first you can
do this:

     my $is_dotified = $REGISTRY->is_class_registered($class);

Examples:

     # Get the metaclass instance for $class
     my $metaclass = $REGISTRY->get_metaclass_for($class);
 
     # Get the class name of the metaclass for $class
     my $metaclass_name = ref $REGISTRY->get_metaclass_for($class);

=head3 C<<< init_metaclass_for($class, $metaclass, $class_options) >>>

Init the metaclass for C<<< $class >>> by creating a new instance of C<<< $metaclass >>>
with options C<<< $class_options >>>.

This is done when you import L<Class::Dot> to your package, so unless
you are working on the internals of Class::Dot or (my god) changing
metaclasses at runtime, you should probably leave this alone.

=head3 C<<< get_options_for($class) >>>

Get the global class options for C<<< $class >>> as a hash reference.

Remember that attributes can overwrite these options in
C<<< $self->__meta__($attribute_name) >>> to specify separate options
for a single attribute. These are just the class defaults.

Examples:

     my $class_options = $REGISTRY->get_options_for($class);
 
     my $is_constrained = $class_options->{'-constrained'};

=head3 C<<< set_options_for($class, $options_ref) >>>

Set the options for C<<< $class >>> to the new hash reference C<<< $options_ref >>>.
This will not merge with the previous options, but B<overwrite the previous
options with the new ones>.

=head3 C<<< get_meta_for($class) >>>

Returns the data structure containing the meta data
for C<<< $class >>>.

=head3 C<<< get_isa_cache_for($class) >>>

Returns the current isa cache for C<<< $class >>>, but B<only if
the class is finalized>.

Returns nothing if C<<< $class >>> is not finalized,
else it returns the isa cache as a hash reference.

=head3 C<<< update_isa_cache_for($class, $isa_cache) >>>

Update the isa cache for C<<< $class >>> with the new isa cache C<<< $isa_cache >>>.
This will not fetch the isa cache, you will have to do that manually.
See C<<< finalize_class($class, $isa_cache) >>>.

You probably want L<Class::Dot|finalize_class($class)>.

=head3 C<<< is_finalized($class) >>>

Returns true if C<<< $class >>> is finalized.

=head3 C<<< finalize_class($class, $isa_cache) >>>

Finalizes the class. You must also give the isa cache, if not
there is not much point in finalizing the class.

You probably want L<Class::Dot|finalize_class($class)> instead.

Example finalizing the class C<<< $class >>>:

     my $REGISTRY  = Class::Dot::Registry->new();
     my $metaclass = $REGISTRY->get_metaclass_for($class);
     my $isa_cache = $metaclass->property->traverse_isa_for_property($class);
     $REGISTRY->finalize_class($class, $isa_cache);

=head2 PRIVATE CLASS METHODS

These are very private methods, and are very likely to change
in the near future, so please stay away from these. They are
only used internally in this class, and it will violate
data privacy and coupling if any of these methods are used
outside of this class.

=head3 C<<< _get_class_meta() >>>

Get direct access to the meta registry for all classes.

=head3 C<<< _get_finalized() >>>

Get direct access to the status of which classes are finalized.

=head3 C<<< _get_isa_cache() >>>

Get direct access to the isa cache for all classes.

=head3 C<<< _get_metaclasses() >>>

Get direct access to the map of metaclasses.

=head3 C<<< _get_options() >>>

Get direct access to all classes options.

=head3 C<<< _get_registered_classes) >>>

Get direct access to the list of which classes are registered.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 C<<< !!! COULD NOT LOAD METACLASS %s FOR CLASS %s !!! >>>

You have probably set a custom metaclass for the class with the C<<< -metaclass >>>
option, but when we tried to load this class it could not be found.

Maybe you have a typo in the metaclass name? Or the class is not installed, or
is not in the path where perl looks for modules. (C<<< @INC >>>).
