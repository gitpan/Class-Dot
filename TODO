* Autogenerate unit tests for the typemap.
* Constructor should call the set accessor itself instead of __setattr__.
  (that is when -override(-new ?) is on).
* Support roles.
* Create method mixin(@;) for adding mixin classes to the class. (use Roles
  implementation) (maybe Class::Dot::Object should be a mixin class?)

* Class::Dot::Meta::Accessor methods has too many arguments. Put them in a
  hash instead

* Croak if adding property/extends/composite and __is_finalized__

* Move perltags things to a new distribution.

* Class::Dot::Meta::Accessor: Don't use load_plugins anymore! Use factory_new
  instead!
