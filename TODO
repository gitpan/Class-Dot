* Autogenerate unit tests fr the typemap.
* Constructor should call the set accessor itself instead of __setattr__.
  (that is when -override-new (?) is on).
* Create method mixin(@;) for adding mixin classes to the class.
  (maybe Class::Dot::Object should be a mixin class?)

* Croak if adding property/extends/composite and __is_finalized__
