    -  isa_Int and isa_String set the initial value to 0 and q{} when no
       default value was defined, this resulted in `defined $property` to
       return true.

1.0.2  Tue Sep 12 10:13:04 2007
    -  Subversion now hosted at googlecode.

1.0.1  Tue Sep 11 24:36:32 2007
    -  isa_Object no longer automaticly makes new objects if the property is
       not set. If you want that, use: isa_Object('My::Class', auto => 1);
    -  Fixed problems with isa_Object where it would try to make
       a new instance even though no default class was defined.
