Revision history for Class-Dot

1.0.1  Tue Sep 11 24:36:32 2007
    -  isa_Object no longer automaticly makes new objects if the property is
       not set. If you want that, use: isa_Object('My::Class', auto => 1);
    -  Fixed problems with isa_Object where it would try to make
       a new instance even though no default class was defined.
