A syntax/perl.vim syntax highlighting file for Vim that highlights 'property'.

Overwrite your existing syntax/perl.vim file, it should be in the vim runtime
directory.

If you can't find this directory you can open vim and type the following
command:

    :echo $VIMRUNTIME

or do it from the shell:

    vim -e --cmd 'echo $VIMRUNTIME' --cmd 'q!'

if all fails you can always fall back to:

    locate perl.vim
